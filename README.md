# myrecipes

Welcome to my recipe project! You are probably here because you followed my gracify tutorial on git! Great!

You can clone this project, so you can run it on your local machine as followed:

git clone https://github.com/janseke10/myrecipes.git

Feel free to mess around with this project a bit, to try out git. Make some changes, push it to the remote repository, etc. 
Have fun.

And i'll see you all soon!
